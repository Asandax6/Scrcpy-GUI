This Is The First Release And There Are Bugs (Plausibly)
.
Scrcpy Will Still Work As Intended But You Can Click Scrcpy-GUI And Use It With a Full GUI (Interface)
.
For **Linux Users**, I Have Yet To Make An Executable So After Extracting Just Click The Scrcpy-GUI Java File And It Will Work.......Java Jre 1.8.0 Required 
.
(**Windows Version Has Bundled Jre So Its Not Needed**)
.
Its Not Perfect, But It Works
